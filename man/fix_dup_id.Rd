\title{Fix replicated id in a data file}
\usage{
fix_dup_id(df, id_str)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A tibble to be examined.}

\item{id_str}{A string that should contain ID name. E.g. "lopnr".}
}
\value{
A list with examination results
\itemize{
  \item logic_rep: If df has replicated ID or not.
  \item new_lopnr: A new distinct ID. E.g, for both people with ID = 2, the new ID are 2.0, 2.1.
  \item replicated_id: Specific replicated ID. May need to report them to local DBM.
  \item df_update: A new df with new_lopnr appened before original ID column.
}
}
\description{
In NEAR, we use ID (lopnr) to identify a specific participant. If two people share the same ID, there must be a problem.
This function is used to:
\itemize{
  \item Check if a data file has replicated ID.
  \item If there is replicated id, find out which IDs are replicated. Generate new distinct new id & append it before the original ID column.
}
The new ID can be temporarily used as primary key when importing data to MySQL.
