During harmonization, there are many repetitive works.    

The goal of creating this package is to practice the "don't repeat yourself" (DRY) principle and make the harmonization more handy.


## Installation

You can install the development version of neartools from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("Bolin-Wu/neartools")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example, eval=FALSE}
library(neartools)

?sav_to_csv
## code usage
sav_to_csv("original_data", "SNAC-K")
```
